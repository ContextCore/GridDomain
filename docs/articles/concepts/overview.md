# Overview

GridDomain heavily relies on DDD approach and uses its terminology. 
In short words, we can say GridDomain is "DDD hiding actors behind it" with a clean separation between domain model itself and execution framework. 

This section contains an overview of DDD approch supported by GridDomain. 
Not technical details, only concepts and vision. 

If you new to DDD/CQRS/ES, we recommend to read concept articles in the following order:

* [Domains](xref:domains-concept)
* [Aggregates](xref:aggregates-concept)
* [Commands](xref:commands-concept)
* [Events](xref:events-concept)
* [Snapshots](xref:snapshots-concept)
* [Event handlers](xref:event-handlers-concept)
* [Projections](xref:projections-concept)
* [Process managers](xref:process-managers-concept)Â
