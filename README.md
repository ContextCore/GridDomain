GridDomain is a framework for the fast construction of extensible, maintainable and scalable applications providing value. It allows developers to focus on domain and business problems rather than infrastructure, performance, persistence implementation and design.

GridDomain takes care of implementing domain logic in server part for web applications or model layer for desktop applications. It is based on CQRS\ES\DDD approaches using actor model and suites very well as an application core in hexagonal architecture. GridDomain supports .Net standard 2.0  and can be used under Windows, Linux and MacOS.
